<h2>Amish</h2>

<p>Amish quilts are reflections of the Amish way of life. As a part of their religious commitment, Amish people have chosen to reject "worldly" elements in their dress and lifestyle, 
and their quilts historically reflected this. Traditionally, they typically used only solid colors in their clothing and the quilts they intend for their own use, in 
community-sanctioned colors and styles. In Lancaster, Pennsylvania, early Amish quilts were typically made of solid-colored, light weight wool fabric, off the same bolts of fabric 
used for family clothing items, while in many midwestern communities cotton predominated. Although classic Amish quilts appear austere from a distance, the craftsmanship is often 
of the highest quality and feature lush quilting patterns that contrast with the plain background. Antique Amish quilts are among the most highly prized among collectors and quilting 
enthusiasts. The quilts created by Amish people in the early period reflect their strong, internal cultural influences, that were to some degree separate from the non-Amish culture 
around them. The color combinations can help experts determine the community in which the quilt was produced. Many consider these quilts the "art" of the Amish. Since the 1970s, 
Amish quiltmakers have made quilts for the consumer market, with quilt cottage industries and retail shops popping up in Amish settlements across North America.</p>


<h2>Baltimore album</h2>

<p>Baltimore album quilts originated in the region around Baltimore, Maryland in the 1840s, where a unique and highly developed applique style of quilting briefly flourished. The quilts 
are created as album quilts, which are collections of appliqued blocks, each with a different design. The designs often feature floral patterns, but many other motifs are used, as well. 
Baskets of flowers, wreaths, buildings, books, and birds were common motifs. Designs were often highly detailed, and displayed the quiltmaker's skill. New dying techniques were available, 
allowing new, bold colors which the quilters used enthusiastically. New techniques with printing on the fabrics also allowed shaded portions of fabric to heighten the three-dimensional 
effect of the designs. The background fabric is typically white or off-white, allowing maximal contrast to the delicate designs. India ink allowed handwritten accents, and allowed the 
blocks to be signed. Some of these quilts were created by professional quilters, and patrons could commission quilts made of new blocks, or select blocks that were already available for 
sale. There has been a resurgence of quilting in the Baltimore style, with many of the modern quilts experimenting with bending some of the old rules.</p>


<h2>Crazy quilts</h2>

<p>Crazy quilts were named because their pieces are not regular, and are scattered across the top of the quilt like "crazed" (cracked or crackled) pottery glazing. They were very refined, 
luxury items, not made randomly. Geometric pieces of rich fabrics were sewn together, and highly decorative embroidery was added. Such quilts were often effectively samplers of embroidery 
stitches and techniques, displaying the development of needle skills of those in the well-to-do late 19th-century home. They were show pieces, not used for warmth, but for late Victorian 
display. The luxury fabrics used precluded frequent washing. They often took years to complete. Fabrics used included silks, wools, velvet, linen, and cotton. Mixtures of fabric textures, 
such as a smooth silk next to a textured brocade or velvet, were embraced. Designs were applied to the surface, and other elements such as ribbons, lace, and decorative cording were used 
exuberantly. Names and dates were often part of the design, and commemorated important events or associations of the maker. Politics were included in some, with printed campaign 
handkerchiefs and other pre-printed textiles (such as advertising silks) often included to declare the maker's sentiments.</p>

<h2>African-American</h2>

<p>By the time that early African American quilting became a tradition in and of itself, it was already a combination of textile traditions from the prominent influences of four civilizations
 of Central and West Africa: the Mande-speaking peoples, the Yoruba and Fon peoples, the Ejagham peoples, and the Kongo peoples. As slaves, their textiles were traded heavily throughout 
 the Caribbean, Central America, and the Southern United States, the traditions of each distinct region became intermixed. Originally, most of the textiles were made by men. Yet when 
 slaves were brought to the United States their work was divided according to Western patriarchal standards and women took over the tradition. However, this strong tradition of weaving 
 left a visible mark on African American quilting. The use of strips, reminiscent of the strips of reed and fabric used in men's traditional weave, are used in fabric quilting. A break 
 in a pattern symbolized a rebirth in the ancestral power of the creator or wearer. And a break in a pattern also helped keep evil spirits away. Evil is believed to travel in straight 
 lines and a break in a pattern or line confuses the spirits and slows them down. This tradition is highly recognizable in African American improvisation of European American patterns. 
 The traditions of improvisation and multiple patterning also protect the quilter from anyone copying their quilts. These traditions allow for a strong sense of ownership and creativity.</p>
 

<h2>Pictorial quilts</h2>

<p>Pictorial Quilts are interesting in that they often contain one of a kind patterns and imagery. Instead of bringing together fabric in an abstract or patterned design, they use pieces 
of fabric to create objects on the quilt, resulting in an picture-based quilt. They were often made collaboratively as a fundraising effort. However, some Pictorial Quilts were 
individually created and tell a narrative through the images on the quilt. Some Pictorial Quilts consist of many squares, sometimes made by multiple people, while others have imagery 
that utilizes the entirety of quilt. Pictorial Quilts were created both in the United States, as well as England and Ireland, beginning as early as 1795.</p>

<h2>Hawaiian</h2>

<p>Hawaiian quilts are whole-cloth (not pieced) quilts, featuring large-scale symmetrical appliqué in solid colors on a solid color (usually white) background fabric. Traditionally, 
the quilter would fold a square piece of fabric into quarters or eighths and then cut out a border design, followed by a center design. The cutouts would then be appliquéd onto a 
contrasting background fabric. The center and border designs were typically inspired by local flora, and often had rich personal associations for the creator, with deep cultural 
resonances. The most common color for the appliquéd design was red, due to the wide availability of Turkey-red fabric.[10] Some of these textiles were not in fact quilted, ultimately, 
but were used as decorative coverings without the heavier batting that was not needed in a tropical climate. Multiple colors were added over time, as the tradition developed. So called 
"echo quilting", where a quilted outline of the applique pattern is repeated like ripples out to the edge of the quilt, is the most common quilting pattern employed on Hawaiian-style 
quilts. Beautiful examples are held in the collection of the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, Honolulu, Hawaii.</p>

<h2>Native American star quilts</h2>

<p>Star Quilts are a Native American form of quilting arising among native women in the late 19th century as communities adjusted to the difficulties of reservation life and cultural 
disruption. They are made by many tribes, but came to be especially associated with Plains tribes, including the Lakota. While star patterns existed in earlier European-American forms 
of quilting, they came to take on special significance for many native artisans.[11] Star quilts are more than an art form—rather, they express important cultural and spiritual values of 
the native women who make them, and continue to have uses in ceremonies and for marking important points in a person's life—from curing or yuwipi ceremonies to memorials. Anthropologists 
(such as Bea Medicine) have documented important social and cultural connections between quilting and earlier important pre-reservation crafting traditions such as women's quill-working 
societies[12] and other crafting traditions that were difficult to sustain after hunting and off-reservation travel was restricted by the US government. Star quilts have also become a 
source of income for many Native American women, while retaining spiritual and cultural importance to their makers.</p>

<h2>Seminole </h2>

<p>Created by the Native Americans of southern Florida, Seminole strip piecing is based on a simple form of decorative patchwork. Seminole strip piecing has uses in quilts, wall hangings, 
and traditional clothing. Seminole patchwork is created by joining a series of horizontal strips, each of which is added to produce repetitive geometric designs.</p>
