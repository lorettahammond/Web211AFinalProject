		<h2>Appliqué </h2>

		<p>
			Appliqué is a sewing technique where an upper layer of fabric is sewn onto a ground fabric, with the raw edges of the "applied" fabric tucked beneath the design
			to minimize raveling or damage. The upper, applied fabric shape can be of any shape or contour. The edge of the upper fabric is folded under as it is sewn down in
			the "needle turn" method, and small hand stitches are made to secure down the design. The stitches are made with a hem stitch, so that the thread securing the fabric
			is minimally visible from the front of the work. There are other methods to secure the raw edge of the applied fabric, and some people use basting stitches,
			fabric-safe glue, freezer paper, paper forms, or starching techniques to prepare the fabric that will be applied, prior to initiating sewing. Supporting paper or
			other materials are typically removed after the sewing is complete. The ground fabric is often cut away from behind, after completion of the sewing of whatever method,
			in order to minimize the bulk of the fabric in that region. A special form of appliqué is "broderie perse", which involves appliqué of specific motifs that have been
			selected from a printed fabric. For example, a series of flower designs might be cut out of one fabric with a vine design, rearranged and sewn down on a new fabric,
			to create the image of a rose bush.
		</p>

		<h2>Reverse Appliqué </h2>

		<p>
			Reverse appliqué is a sewing technique where a ground fabric is cut, and another piece of fabric is placed under the ground fabric, and the raw edges of the ground
			fabric are tucked under and the newly folded edge is sewn down to the lower fabric. Stitches are made as inconspicuous as possible. Reverse appliqué techniques are
			often used in combination with traditional appliqué techniques, to give a variety of visual effects.
		</p>

		<h2>Trapunto</h2>

		<p>
			Trapunto is a sewing technique where two layers of fabric surrounding a layer of batting are quilted together, and then additional material is added to a portion of
			the design to increase the profile of relief as compared to the rest of the work. The effect of the elevation of one portion is often heightened by closely quilting
			the surrounding region, to compress the batting layer in that part of the quilt, thus receding the background even further. "Cording" techniques may also be used,
			where a channel is created by quilting, and a cord or yarn is pulled through the batting layer, causing a sharp change in the texture of the quilt. For example,
			several pockets may be quilted in the pattern of a flower, and then extra batting pushed through a slit in the backing fabric (and this slit later sewn shut). The
			stem of the rose might be corded, creating a dimensional effect. The background could be quilted densely in a stipple pattern, causing the space around the rose bush
			to become less prominent. These techniques are typically executed with whole cloth quilts, and with batting and thread that matches the top fabric. Some artists have
			used contrasting colored thread, to create an "outline" effect. Colored batting behind the surface layer can create a shadowed effect. Brightly colored yarn cording
			behind white cloth can give a pastel effect on the surface.

		<h2>English Paper Piecing</h2>

		<p>
			English paper piecing is a hand sewing technique, used to maximize accuracy when piecing complex angles together. A paper shape is cut with the exact dimensions of
			the desired piece. Fabric is then basted to the paper shape. Adjacent units are then placed face to face and the seam is whip stitched together. When a given piece is
			completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the basting thread is cut, and the basting and the paper shape are removed.
		</p>


		<h2>Foundation Piecing</h2>

		<p>
			Foundation piecing is a sewing technique that allows maximum stability of the work as the piecing is created, minimizing the distorting effect of working with
			slender pieces or bias cut pieces. In the most basic form, a piece of paper is cut the size of the desired block. For utility quilts, a sheet of newspaper was used.
			In modern foundation piecing, an elaborate design featuring pointed shapes, is used. A strip of fabric or a fabric scrap is sewn by machine to the foundation. The
			fabric is flipped back, and pressed. The next piece of fabric is sewn through the initial piece and paper. Subsequent pieces are added sequentially. The block may be
			trimmed, flush with the border of the foundation. After the blocks are sewn together, the paper is removed, unless the foundation is an acid-free material.
		</p>

		<h2>Embellishment</h2>

		<p>
			Additional decorative elements may be added to the surface of a quilt to add a 3-dimensional or whimsical effect. The most common objects sewn on are beads or
			buttons. Decorative trim, piping, sequins, found objects, or other items can be secured to the surface. The topic of embellishment is explored further in another
			topic.
