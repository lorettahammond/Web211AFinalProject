				<strong>
					Congratulations on completing your quilt top!  Now, you are ready to layer the backing, batting, and quilt top.  Before you begin quilting, you must
					prepare.
			</em></strong>
		</p>

		<h2>Preparing to Quilt</h2>

		<p>Cut and piece the backing fabric and the batting to a size about 6” larger than your quilt top.  Don’t worry about precision; the excess material will be cut away.</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Choose a quilting method.  There are several quilting options for holding your quilt together:</dt>
			<br>
			<dd><strong>Machine Quilting</strong></dd>

			<dl>
				Machine quilting is relatively fast and the stitches are durable.  With machine quilting, your quilting can be simple straight lines or intricate
				designs,depending on your skill level.
			</dl>


			<dd><strong>Hand Quilting</strong></dd>

			<dl>
				Hand quilting is an age-old art, one that enhances the value (emotional and financial) of your work.  Hand quilting is time consuming, yet not
				difficult.
			</dl>

			<dd><strong>Tying</strong></dd>

			<dl>
				Tying is by far the quickest, yet it will not hold up as well to wear and tear.  Tying does not provide the texture and life that quilting stitches
				add.
			</dl>

		</dl>

		<p>Note: If you will be hand or machine quilting, mark your quilt top with the quilting pattern of your choice. If you plan to tie your quilt, no marking is necessary.</p>

		<p>
			Tip: There are a variety of wash-out or disappearing markers available at your quilt shop.  Avoid the heartache of marks that won’t go away.  Test on a scrap of your fabric before
			marking your quilt top.
		</p>

		<h2>Quilting Styles</h2>
		<p>
			After you chosen whether you're going to hand quilt or machine quilt your project, you need to decide the quilting style that you'll use.  The most common
			choices include: In the Ditch; Straight Line; Outline; Echo; Stipple; Meandering; Channel; Grid; Decorative-Stitch; Motif; and Free Motion.  Each of these
			are described below.</p>

		<h3><em>In The Ditch</em></h3>


		<p>
			Now you see it, now you don't! Stitch-in-the ditch quilting disappears into the piecing seamlines and should not be visible on the pieces if it's done properly.
			Often sewn with invisible thread, this type of quilting is common on strip and block pieced designs to keep layers from shifting. If seams are pressed in one direction,
			stitch-in-the-ditch quilting should be done on the opposite side of the seam (the low side).
		</p>

		<p>Some quilters prefer to stitch 1/8" or 1/4" away from the seam lines, a technique that's more often called outline quilting.</p>

		<p>
			Even though stitching in the ditch is somewhat invisible on the top of the quilt, it does secure all three layers of the quilt sandwich. Quilters often choose either a matching thread
			or a very fine, invisible thread called monofilament when stitching in the ditch.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Straight Line</em></h3>

		<p>
			This method utilizes only straight lines sewn across the quilt top in various directions. Similar to sewing in the ditch, straight line quilting utilizes a standard sewing approach.
			However, you can create different effects with straight line quilting, such as channel, diagonal or crosshatch quilting.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Outline</em></h3>

		<p>
			Outline quilting highlights a shape using only a single line of stitching 1/4" from the shape edge—either inside or outside. The width of the presser foot can be used as a guide to
			avoid marking.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Echo</em></h3>

		<p>
			If you've appliquéd a flower or intricately pieced a shape, highlight it with two or more rows of parallel stitching lines mimicking the shape. It's easy to do by using the width of
			your presser foot to space the rows equi-distant, though they can also be spaced differently, depending on the desired look. This type of quilting needs no marking as the highlighted
			shape determines the stitching pattern.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Stipple</em></h3>

		<p>
			Stippling is an all over random pattern of quilting that provides surface interest. Often used in combination with other types of quilting, stippling is frequently used to
			highlight background sections of a quilt. Stippling is done free-motion by lowering the machine feed dogs, installing a darning foot and moving the quilt randomly to
			create the patterning. Well executed stippling lines don't cross or touch each other, but appear totally random.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Meandering</em></h3>

		<p>
			Much like stippling, only more widely spaced, meandering forms a pattern of curved lines and swirls. There's no need to mark this type of stitching, and it's accomplished with
			free-motion work like stippling.
		</p>


		<h3><em>Channel Quilting</em></h3>

		<p>
			Evenly stitched parallel lines form channels over the quilt surface to hold the layers together, and this patterning can be done using a quilting guide attached to the presser foot
			for even spacing, or lines can be marked with chalk or tape. Lines can be at an angle or straight.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Grid Quilting</em></h3>

		<p>
			If parallel lines are stitched in two directions forming a crosshatching pattern, the quilt is said to be quilted with gridwork. The lines can be at right angles to each other
			forming squares, or at another angle forming diamond shapes. Grids can be marked on the quilt surface or sewn using a presser foot with an attached quilting guide for spacing.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Decorative-stitch Quilting</em></h3>

		<p>
			Waves, scallops, ducks, flowers and other built-in stitches can be used to hold quilt layers together. They can be stitched in grid patterns, as parallel lines or in patterns
			like circles. Choose a decorative stitch that is open (not dense) for best results.
		</p>


		<h3><em>Motif Quilting</em></h3>

		<p>
			Stitching designs like feathers, circles, flowers or other patterns over the quilt surface is called motif quilting. Designs need to be marked on the surface for consistency
			and even placement, or they can be freehanded randomly over the quilt for a more eclectic look. Quilting templates and stencils can be used for marking stitching lines, though
			the size may need to be adjusted to fit your particular quilt spacing needs.
		</p>


		<h3><em>Free Motion</em></h3>

		<p>
			This type of quilting covers a broad spectrum. In free motion quilting, you are in control – not the machine. This means the machine does not help feed the fabric; you have to
			move the fabric under the needle in a specific pattern or motion. You can think of it like moving the paper under a pencil to write a letter, instead of moving the pencil over
			the paper. The exciting part about this technique is how you can create very simple designs (like circles), complex designs (like feathers), do what’s called echo quilting
			(where you outline a focal point), or try what’s known as stippling or meandering (we have to show you this one to best explain it, but "meandering" is a great way to think about
			it). Many quilters love the final quilting process because it’s such an enjoyable and expressive form of creativity.
