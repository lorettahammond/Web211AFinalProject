<h2 class=”hdg”>Step 2: Start Your Quilt: Preparation and Layout</h2>

	<ol>
	
		<li><strong><em>Prewash fabric</em></strong></li>

			<ol>Although not everyone chooses to do this, prewashing your fabric will shrink it and rinse out any extra dye - things that might ruin your quilt after 
			finishing if not done earlier. Higher quality fabrics will not lose dye or shrink so much, but it is best to wash your fabric regardless of the quality. 
			This will also remove any dirt or grime that made its way onto the fabric. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Press the fabric</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>To remove any wrinkles and make cutting easier, press your fabric with an iron. Use the steam setting if you have it available. You needn’t iron the 
			batting - only the fabric for the front and the back of the quilt will need it. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Make the necessary measurements</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>If you know how large you want your quilt to be, you need to measure the size of each of the individual pieces to fit. The trickiest part of measuring 
			is remembering the seam allowance; each side of the fabric will be sewn to another side of fabric using a ¼-inch seam allowance. This means that you must 
			add ¼ inch to the sides of each piece. For example, if you want your quilt to be made of 4-inch squares, you will need to measure and cut each square to be
			4½ x 4½ inches. The extra ½ inch will be sewn as the seam allowance. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>The size of your quilt and each piece is rather arbitrary unless you are using a specific pattern. Therefore, make your pieces as large or small as you
			like based on your skill level. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>If it helps, you can use a washable fabric pen to mark your measurements on your fabric prior to cutting. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Cut the necessary pieces</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>Focus on the front of the quilt for now; cut out each of the small pieces of fabric that you will be quilting together. Lay each piece on your cutting 
			board and place your clear ruler over the top. Use your rotary blade to run across the fabric along the exact lines on the cutting mat. Follow the old 
			saying of “measure twice, cut once,” to make sure that you don’t accidentally make a mistake in cutting. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Lay out your quilt</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>This part of the process is enjoyable - now you get to design your quilt! Lay out all the little pieces you have just cut into the pattern you think 
			you want. It’s easiest to do this on the floor where you have plenty of space to work with. Make sure that you have your pattern exactly how you want it, 
			even if you rearrange the whole thing several times. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>You may find that you want to add additional fabric pieces in a different color or pattern at this point. Simply substitute out some of your pre-cut 
			squares for new ones in different prints. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>Keep track of the rows of fabric by using post-it notes or chalk to mark each piece. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Stack up the rows</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>It is a little inconvenient to have a giant quilt pattern laid out on your floor, so stack up the pieces in order. Work from left to right across the
			rows, stacking each piece on top of the one before it. Then, you can mark the top of each row with a post-it note to know what order it should go in. </ol>
