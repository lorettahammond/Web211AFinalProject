<h2>Choosing Quilt Fabric</h2>

<p>When choosing fabrics for a quilt, often doubts arise. Does fabric A combine well with fabric B? Should I use solid colors or prints? How many different fabrics can I use in a quilt? 
My number one suggestion is: go with your instincts. Color -- and beauty in general -- is perceived with our senses... and this case particularly through our sight. If you like the fabric 
you've chosen... go for it!</p>


<p>However, if you don't feel quite comfortable yet with your instincts, there are a few suggestions in choosing fabric for a fabulous quilt. Prior to choosing your fabrics, let's look at 
a few fabric considerations to keep in mind when choosing fabrics and fabric color palettes.</p>

<h2>Fabric Considerations</h2>

<p><strong><em>Fabric type.</em></strong></p>

<p>There are many different fabrics you can use for your quilt: velvet, wool, leather, denim, silk, among many others. But although you can use nearly any kind of fabric, 
100% cotton fabric is still the most preferred material for quilt. One, it is easy to press and quilt. Second, it is less likely to fray. And third, it maintains its color. 
Of course, the type of fabric to use still depends on the pattern you have in mind, so don’t feel limited with your fabric choices.</p>

<p><strong><em>Thread count.</em></strong></p>

<p>It refers to the number of threads per square inch and is used to indicate how fine a fabric is. A thread count that is anywhere between 68 to 78 is a good indication that a
 fabric can last and is less likely to shrink. To know if a fabric has an ideal thread count, check the threads. If the threads look intact and don’t easily pull apart, you are holding 
 a good choice.</p>

<p><strong><em>Print.</em></strong></p>

<p>There are three things you need to remember when choosing prints. One, you should have a variety of small, medium, and large prints in your fabrics to lend texture and dimension to 
your quilt. Fabrics with almost the same size of prints tend to look boring and flat if pieced together. On the contrary, a range of sizes gives depth and movement to the quilt. Second, 
check that the print is on the grain. A print that is not aligned with the grain has the possibility of creating a distorted and crooked design. Finally, examine pattern consistency and 
make sure that the entire fabric is printed. If there seems to be empty spaces where prints should have been, you may not be able to use some parts of the fabric.</p>

<p><strong><em>Color.</em></strong></p>

<p>The most important component of a quilting fabric is the color. A coherent and dynamic color scheme gives the quilt an interesting visual appeal, so it is very important to be careful 
with the color combination. To come up with a coherent color combination, you have to choose a main fabric that has many different colors. Then, select fabrics with colors pulled out from 
the main fabric. To avoid dullness, pick the quilting fabrics within the range of light, medium, and dark hues.</p>

<p>These are the color values and are important in balancing the overall color of the quilt. Two tips when buying a fabric: make sure the color doesn’t fade in some parts; choose the fabric 
whose color doesn’t come off on the hands when rubbed.</p>



<h2>Fabric Choice</h2>

<p><strong><em>Pick a primary fabric.</em></strong></p>

<p>When you’re trying to find an array of different fabrics for the same quilt, it helps to have a primary – or focus – fabric that functions as an anchor for everything else you choose. Once you find that perfect fabric, you can pick the rest of your fabrics based on how they match the primary one.</p>

<p><strong><em>Check out the color wheel.</em></strong></p>

<p>You might be surprised what kind of inspiration could come from the color wheel! Craftsy points out that it’s a helpful tool for quickly identifying complementary colors, warm and cool color palettes, and seeing different shades all in the same place. Simple but helpful!</p>

<p><strong><em>Try to choose fabrics of the same material.</em></strong></p>

<p>This isn’t too tough because so many fabrics are 100% cotton, but Diary of a Quilter suggests working with the same type of material throughout the entire quilt. This also works well for washing purposes, because the entire quilt will follow the same cleaning instructions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Consider who is receiving the quilt.</em></strong></p> 

<p>If you’re making something for yourself, then picking whatever colors and designs that you like is easier. But if you’re making a gift for someone, keep that in mind when browsing for fabrics – what colors would they like? How old are they? Do they have any fabric allergies? Knowing some of these particulars can help you narrow down the fabric field.</p>

<p><strong><em>Incorporate lots of variety.</em></strong></p>

<p>Something that many quilters recommend – including those at Quiltbug.com – is using different scales and colors in fabrics so that the quilt as a whole really pops. Pick some fabrics with small little designs, others with big booming patterns, and some solids to balance everything out – that way your quilt will have a lot of dimension.</p>
<p>Compare fabric swatches before sewing the quilt.

<p>Another great suggestion from Diary of a Quilter is cutting out swatches of all the fabrics you’ve chosen, and putting them side-by-side to see if everything matches. That way, if you start to feel iffy about one of the patterns, you haven’t started building the quilt yet.</p>

<p><strong><em>Take risks!</em></strong></p>

<p>Quilting is all about expressing your creativity, so have fun with it! You can tell which colors look good together, and if you buy a fabric and decide it’s not exactly what you wanted, you can add it to the fabric stash for another time. </p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with taking a shopping trip through your own growing collection of fabrics! While these tips are helpful, there are no strict rules about what colors or materials to pick – go with your gut!</p>
<p>Browsing and picking fabrics are really enjoyable parts of the process, so don’t let the stress of too many choices overwhelm you. Have fun!</p>
