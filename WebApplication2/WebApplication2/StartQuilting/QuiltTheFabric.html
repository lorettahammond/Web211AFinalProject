<h2 class=”hdg”>Step 3: Quilt the Fabric: Assemble Rows</h2>

	<ol>
	
		<li><strong><em>Sew the rows</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>Begin your quilt by sewing each individual row of pieces together. Work by starting at one end of your row with two of your squares of fabric. Place 
			the two squares with the pattern facing each other. Then, use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew a ¼-inch inseam. Then, add the next square 
			in the row to the one before it, using the same process. Work across each row so they are all sewn together in long, thin strips. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>Pin each square to the one it is being sewn to before sewing to help keep them in line. </ol>
		<br>
			<ol>Getting a consistent inseam on all your pieces is vital to having your pattern line up in the finished quilt. Make sure that you are sewing at exactly
			¼ inch for each piece of fabric. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Press the rows</em></strong></li>
			<br>
			<ol>l>With each of the pieces sewn together, the back will be left with columns of inseams that stick up. To make your final quilt lay flat and look more 
			finished, press these inseams flat with your iron. Iron each row in the opposite direction; iron all the inseams in the first row to the right, in the 
			second row to the left, in the third row to the right, et cetera. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Sew the rows together</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>Use the same process as you did for sewing each small square of fabric together to sew each row of fabric together. Take two adjacent rows and turn 
			them inwards so the patterns are facing each other. Sew along the bottom using a ¼-inch inseam. Repeat this process for each additional row, until you 
			have a complete quilt front. </ol>
			<br>
			<ol>If the rows and pieces do not line up, do not worry! Your quilt will still look lovely even with some minor mistakes. </ol>
		<br>
		<li><strong><em>Press the quilt front</em></strong></li>
		<br>
			<ol>Flip your quilt front over so the backside is exposed. Use the same technique for ironing each individual row for ironing the entire back of the quilt. 
			Flatten out the inseams in opposite directions - the first row left, second row right, third row left, et cetera. Doing a quality job on pressing the 
			fabric will make sewing the whole thing together much easier. </ol>
