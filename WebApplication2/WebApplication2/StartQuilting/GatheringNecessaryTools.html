<h2 class=”hdg”>Step 1: Gathering the Necessary Tools</h2>

<p> To create a level, symmetrical quilt, it is important to start with equally cut pieces of fabric. Not only does having a good cutting tool make the product more professional looking, it also speeds up the process of making a quilt and adds ease for beginners. Regular sewing scissors can be used, but rotary cutters are typically considered the easiest and fastest of the cutting tools. </p>

		<dt><strong><em>Cutting Tools & Accessories</em></strong></dt>
		<br>
		<dd><strong><em>Rotary cutters</em></strong>: Come in a variety of sizes, but a medium size is the best to start with. </dd>
			
		<dd><strong><em>Scissors</em></strong>: If you choose to use regular scissors, be sure that they are well sharpened and will not snag the fabric.</dd>
		
		<dd><strong><em>Cutting mat</em></strong>: Cutting your fabric on a regular tabletop may seem the easiest, but you are likely to score your furniture and you will not be 
		able to get as straight of a line. Get a self-healing cutting mat to cut against to prevent this. These come with a printed ruler on the topside, making 
		lining up your fabric and getting the perfect edges easy.</dd>

		<dd><strong><em>Ruler</em></strong>: Not just any ruler, an extra long and wide ruler will work best for quilting. Find a ruler that is 5x24 inches and made of a 
		transparent plastic. This ruler will allow you to sandwich your fabric between your cutting board and the ruler to make perfect cuts every time. If you are 
		working on a small quilt, a 5x12 inch ruler is a fine tool to use too.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<dl>
		<dt><strong><em>Sewing basics</em></strong>: These are the things that are useful for any sewing project, including straight pins, safety pins, and a seam ripper. If you don’t have them already, they 
		are available at craft and sewing supply stores. You will need many straight and safety pins for sewing a quilt, so stock up on these in particular.</dt>
		<br>
			<dt><strong><em>Thread:</em></strong>Thread seems universal, but is available in many different materials and colors. Avoid using a cheap thread as it is more likely to break when sewing and 
			give off lint when washed. Higher quality cotton thread is the best option for a quilt. If you want to use your thread for multiple projects, buy a spool of a 
			neutral color like white, tan, or gray.</dt>
			<br>
			<dt><strong><em>Fabric</em></strong>: The most important step in making a quilt is preparing the fabric. With thousands of fabrics available on the market, this task can seem a bit daunting. 
			A basic quilt can most easily be made of 100% cotton fabric, although polyester and polyester/cotton blends are also options. Choose several different fabrics 
			for the front of the quilt, the border, as well as 1-2 primary fabrics for the quilt backing. </dt>
		
				<br>
				<dd>Consider the colors and scale you are using. How many different colors do you want to incorporate? How many different patterns? Try to get a good mix 
				of large and small patterns as well as colors from the same family. </dd>
				<br>
				<dd>Get creative with your fabric options. Look for vintage tablecloths or sheets at thrift stores rather than relying solely on the fabric options at 
				your local sewing store. </dd>
				<br>
				<dd>Your backing fabric will be larger than both the front of your quilt and the batting, so make sure that you get enough to allow for a bigger size.</dd>

		<br>
			
		<dt><strong><em>Batting</em></strong>: Batting, also called filling or wadding, is the fluffy material that adds warmth to your quilt. It is sandwiched between the front of your quilt and the 
		backing.</dt>
				<br>
				<dd> Batting comes in several different fibers, including cotton, polyester, cotton blend, bamboo, and fusible. It is sold in different “lofts” or 
				thicknesses; a smaller loft is thinner, while a higher loft is thicker. </dd>
				<br>
				<dd>Polyester batting is more likely to spread out towards the edges of your quilt over time and fusible batting has high chances of puckering. Therefore, 
				beginners should look into the cotton, cotton blend, or bamboo batting options first. </dd>
				<br>
				<dd>If you’re making a large quilt, such as a comforter for a bed, using a higher loft may be preferred. Smaller quilts may not require such thick batting, 
				unless you want an extra warm blanket</dd>
		
		<br>
		
		<dt><strong><em>Sewing Machine:</em></strong> Although you can hand-stitch a quilt, the process is much more time-intensive and a bit more daunting for beginner quilters. Use a sewing machine for the 
		easiest quilt; any machine that can make a straight line will do fine! Be sure to have plenty of spare needles to keep your machine running smoothly.</dt>
		
		<br>
		
		<dt><strong><em>Iron</em></strong>: It will be necessary to press your quilt at several points in the process, so get an iron (preferably with steaming abilities) to use for this. Don’t worry 
		about using a fancy or expensive iron - a trip to your local thrift store may be all you need. </dt>

		<br>
		
		<dt><strong><em>Pattern</em></strong>: Although you don’t need a pattern to make a quilt, it is sometimes helpful to have a basic pattern to work with.<dt>
				<br>
				<dd> Free quilt patterns are available online, or you can purchase a book of patterns from a sewing shop. If you would rather design your own pattern 
				based on your own measurements, a bit of graphing paper and a pencil is all you need. <dd>
				<br>
				<dd>Even if you do not purchase or make a pattern, drawing a rough sketch of your design before starting is highly recommended. </dd>
				<br>
				<dd>The easiest quilt for beginners is a blanket made of rows of quilted squares. Using larger pieces for each square will be easier than many small 
				pieces. </dd>
