        <h2 class=”hdg”>Step 4: Put it all together: bringing together your quilt top, batting, backing, and edging.</h2>

        <ol class="margins-removed">
            <li><strong><em>Cut the remaining fabric</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                With the top of your quilt finished, the batting and backing need to be cut as well. These should be slightly larger than your quilt
                front, to allow for any scrunching the fabric may do during the sewing process. Measure and cut both the batting and backing to be 2-3
                inches larger than the front piece of your quilt.
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong><em>Baste the quilt</em></strong></li>
            
            <ol>
                Basting is the process of layering your quilt and pinning it in place before sewing. There are two options for basting - using safety
                pins to hold the pieces in place, or using a spray-on basting adhesive. Lay your fabrics in the order they will appear on your quilt -
                the backing pattern side down, then the batting, then the quilt front pattern side up. Line up all the sides and smooth out any wrinkles.
                Work out the wrinkles starting from the center and going in an outwards direction.
            </ol>
            
            <ol>
                If you use a basting spray, lightly mist each layer before adding the next one on top of it. Smooth out the fabric after the spray has
                secured the layers in place.
            </ol>
           
            <ol>If you are pinning your quilt together, use safety pins in the center of each piece. Work from the center outwards as you pin. </ol>
          
            <ol>
                If you want to be extra cautious, you can use both basting techniques by spraying and pinning your quilt in place. Doing this will
                make sure that your quilt is extra secure before sewing.
            </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Sew the layers together</em></strong></li>
            
            <ol>
                Start in the center of your quilt and sew outwards to push excess fabric and bunching towards the edges rather than the middle. The
                easiest way of sewing the layers of the quilt together is to “stitch the ditch,” or sew inside or near the seams you have already created
                between pieces. You can also choose to sew diagonally across pieces or free hand the seams on your sewing machine.
            </ol>
            
            <ol>
                If you want to make sure you are sewing in the right place, use a washable sewing pen to mark the exact locations on your quilt that
                you want to sew.
            </ol>
           
            <ol>
                The more seams you sew through the entire quilt, the better the finished product will be. Adding more seams will prevent the batting
                from moving around or bunching inside the quilt.
            </ol>
            
            <ol>You can add a border seam around the edge of your quilt once you have sewn together the entire center of your blanket. </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Cut the binding</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                The binding is a border of fabric that goes around the edge of your quilt to protect the seams and add a more finished look. You can
                choose to cut your binding horizontally/vertically or on the bias, with the latter allowing for more flexibility. Cut your strips (you
                will have to overlap some most likely) to be 2½ inches wide and long enough to go around the entire perimeter of your quilt. Sew together
                the strips so you have 4 pieces equal to the lengths of the 4 sides of your quilt.
            </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Press the binding</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                If you had to sew together multiple pieces of fabric to create a single length for the binding, press the seams flat at this point.
                Then, fold the binding in half lengthwise and iron the fabric. This will leave you with a pressed seam running down the middle of the
                entire binding.
            </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Pin the binding in place</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                Lay the binding for two opposite sides down on the top of your quilt. Set the binding so the edges line up, and the patterns are face
                to face (the back of the binding will be facing you). Use plenty of pins to secure the fabric in place like this.
            </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Sew the front of the binding</em></strong></li>
            
            <ol>
                Go along the edge of the quilt and the binding and sew using a ½-inch inseam. This should be done on both of the sides of fabric,
                leaving you with a quilt with two pieces of backwards binding sewn in place. Then, fold the fabric up and away from the center of the
                quilt, exposing the printed side of the binding.
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong><em>Add the remaining binding</em></strong></li>
            
            <ol>
                Place the other two strips of binding along the open sides of the quilt. Use the same process as the original two sides, sewing the
                binding along the edge with a ½-inch seam allowance. Then, fold the fabric outwards and away from the center of the quilt, exposing the
                pattern.
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong><em>Fold the binding over</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                Flip your quilt over so the back of it is exposed. The edges of your binding should be sticking up all the way around your quilt.
                Start on one side by folding the edge of the binding to meet the edge of the quilt. Then, fold the rest of the binding over so that it
                overlaps with the back of the quilt. You can iron the binding down to help keep in place, and then add plenty of pins to secure it.
                Do this with all the sides of your quilt.
            </ol>
           
            <li><strong><em>Finish the binding</em></strong></li>
            
            <ol>
                Sewing the binding on the backside is tricky, because the stitches will show through on the front. Therefore, you have two options
                to minimize the amount of thread that will be seen: use an invisible thread to sew the binding, or hand stitch it with a whipstitch or
                a ladder stitch, making sure to avoid going through all three layers of your quilt. Work your way around the edges of the quilt, making
                sure that your corners are squared off and your seams are even.
            </ol>
            
            <li><strong><em>Finish your quilt</em></strong></li>
           
            <ol>
                With the addition of the binding, your quilt has been finished! Wash your quilt again if you like to give it a soft, vintage-y feel.
                Otherwise, your quilt is ready to go. Enjoy!
