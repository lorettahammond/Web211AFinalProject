			<h2>Fabric Preparation, Pressing, and Squaring Your Fabric. </h2>

			<p><strong><em>Washing</em></strong></p>

			<p>Eternal quilting question: <span style="color:#800080;">To wash, or not to wash?</span></p>
			<p>The answer is simple: It depends. </p>

			<p>There are three reasons to prewash:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>colorfastness</li>
				<li>shrinkage</li>
				<li>chemicals</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Colorfastness</strong></span><br></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					Soak a piece of white fabric in hot water with a little detergent in it. Remove the fabric and squeeze out most of the water. Rub the white fabric on the
					questionable fabric. If the white fabric picks up any color, you should pre-wash.
				</li>
				<li>
					Get a piece of white cotton fabric wet then place it on a piece of your questionable fabric and press with a hot iron until the fabric is dry. If the white
					fabric picks up any color, you should pre-wash.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cut a small piece of the questionable fabric, maybe 2″ square, and place it in a clear or white dish with hot water and a touch of detergent. Swish it around,
					then let it soak for a few minutes. Remove the fabric – if the water is colored, you should pre-wash.
				</li>
				<li>
					Follow the steps in #3, but after soaking, remove the fabric and blot it with a piece of white fabric or paper towel. If the white fabric shows any color,
					you should pre-wash.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				If you decide to pre-wash because of colorfastness issues, you may decide to treat the fabric when you wash it.  Two choices for treating your fabric include:
				Synthrapol and Retayne. They have two very different functions, so be sure to use the correct product at the correct time. Many quilt shops are carrying these
				products (JoAnn’s has it online, and possibly in stores), but you can also order them online.
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="http://www.dharmatrading.com/html/eng/1981-AA.html">Retayne</a> should be used when you pre-wash fabric. It is a fixative that keep the dye in the fabric.
				Retayne does NOT work in front loading washers, so you would have to hand wash your fabrics if you use it. It doesn’t work on every kind of dye, so you should test
				your fabric again after using it. You should NOT wash a completed quilt with Retayne!<br>

				<a href="http://www.dharmatrading.com/html/eng/2127-AA.html">Synthrapol</a> keeps any loose dye in the water from attaching to the fabric. You can use it when
				pre-washing, especially if you have a multicolor print fabric. You can also wash a completed quilt with Synthrapol to keep the loose dye from migrating to light
				colored fabric.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are other products you can use when washing the finished quilt. <a href="http://www.shoutitout.com/en-US/Products/Pages/shout-color-catcher.aspx">
					Shout
					Color Catchers
				</a> are disposable sheets (similar to fabric softener sheets) that soak up the loose dye in the water and prevent it from migrating to other fabrics.
				Some people use several sheets in the first washing; we use a couple of color catchers the first few washes (we even include them with instructions when we give a
				quilt as a gift). They are commonly available in stores in the US, and right now you can receive a <a href="http://www.shoutitout.com/en-US/Promotions/Pages/ColorCatcher.aspx">
					free sample
				</a> from the website. <a href="http://www.carbona.com/color-grabberreusablecloth.html">Carbona Dye Grabber</a> is a similar product, but can be used up
				to 30 times before it loses effectiveness. It looks like a small terrycloth wash cloth.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Shrinkage</strong></span><br>

				Some fabrics shrink more than others. The better the fabric quality, the less it will shrink. Very cheap quality fabric not only shrinks more, but may shrink
				inconsistently (top/bottom vs. left/right). This is one of the reasons to be picky about the quality of fabric that is uses. If you work with flannel, you should
				always pre-wash because it shrinks considerably more than regular quilting cotton. If you mix fabric types, again, pre-wash everything so your finished quilt
				will not turn into a misshapen mess.
			</p>

			<p>
				You might have heard that not pre-washing your fabric gives you an old-fashioned puckery look when you wash your quilt. That’s not entirely true. The puckery
				look comes from the batting shrinking. If you use batting made from polyester (or batting made from recycled plastic bottles), the quilt stays very flat and smooth
				because the batting doesn’t shrink much – less than 1%. Cotton and wool (and other natural fibers) will shrink as much as 5%.
			</p>

			<p>
				<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Chemicals</strong></span><br>

				Chemicals are not necessarily a bad thing when you’re storing your fabric. If you find that your hands get painfully dry or itchy, or you have trouble with
				sneezing or a runny nose when you’re sewing, then pre-wash the fabric and avoid the misery. I really like working with fabric that still has the sizing in because
				it is firmer and sturdier. Some people like to wash the fabric to remove the preservatives, then add starch or sizing back in either in the wash or with a spray
				when ironing.
			</p>

			<h3>Pressing and Straightening</h3>

			<p>
				Now that you’ve pre-washed (or not) and dried your fabric, you need to press it. Ideally, you should press it even if you didn’t pre-wash it. Fabric isn’t always
				put on the bolt perfectly straight, and it’s best if you find the grain before cutting.
			</p>

			<p>
				You may wash your fabric a little differently. First, iron the fabric to remove all creases and wrinkles.  Keep a spray bottle filled with a mixture of water and
				vodka handy to mist the fabric as you iron.
			</p>

			<p>Wait – VODKA?!!</p>

			<p>
				Yes! You can buy spray starches and sizings and fancy Best Press. If you don't pre-wash your fabrics, the sizing is still in it and all you really want to do is
				refresh it. The vodka seems to give it a slightly crisper finish.  Many quilters think it makes the fabric smell a little better. (It doesn’t smell at all alcohol-y.)
				If you have trouble with the scent of the vodka/water, you can add a drop of essential oil, such as lavender, rose, or ylang ylang – whatever you have on hand. You
				can even add a couple drops of your favorite perfume if you like. Such essential oils are good for removing odors from fabric, similar to Febreeze, only a much
				cheaper. Simply mix approximately 1 part vodka to 3 parts water. For example, if you use a 16 ounce bottle, put in half a cup of vodka and fill it up with water,
				then shake. If you’re adding oil, mix that with the vodka first to emulsify, then add the water.
			</p>

			<p>
				If the fabric piece is larger than a yard, you can usually cut off a chunk so it’s easier to work with. This results in a little fabric waste, but it’s worth it
				for ease of handling. It's recommended to iron the fabric so it’s nice and smooth, opening it to iron a single layer and press out the fold line. That’s where the
				spray really helps. Once it’s smooth,fold it with the right side out, lining up the selvages.
			</p>

			<p>The next photo shows that the cut edges are also lined up – this is how the fabric came off the bolt.</p>

			<a href="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-2.jpg">
				<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-2.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2646">
			</a>

			<p>Look at the fabric – if it looks warped and bubbled, that means the fabric was a bit crooked on the bolt. The arrows point out the ripples.</p>

			<a href="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-3.jpg">
				<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-3.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2647">
			</a>

			<p>Slide the front half of the fabric left or right as needed until it hangs straight. You may lose as much as a few inches of fabric in the squaring up process. </p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-4.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 4" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2648">

			<p>As you can see, even though this is a very good quality fabric, it was still a little crooked. About an inch of fabric is lost once it was trimmed.</p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-5.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 5" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2644">

			<p>Once it hangs straight, lightly press the fold to keep it from sliding around. </p>

			<h3>Squaring Up</h3>

			<p>
				Hopefully, you already have all of the tools and supplies you need. The three very essential tools are your self-healing mat, rotary cutter, and acrylic ruler.
				Ideally, when you’re cutting fabric, you should measure with either the ruler OR the mat – never both.
			</p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-7.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 7" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2652">

			<p>You’ll use the ruler to find the straight edge and measure, so the lines on the mat just create confusion and extra work. </p>


			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-6.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 6" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2651">

			<p>Some may not like to use the lines on the mat, while others may prefer to use them. Try it both ways and find what works for you. </p>

			<p>
				Place the fabric on the mat, making sure the edge you will be cutting is completely ON the mat, not hanging off an edge. Cutting off the edge of the mat not only
				causes skips in the fabric, it can permanently damage your blade. Place the ruler on the fabric so the cut edge of the fabric extends past the edge for the full
				length of the ruler.
			</p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-8.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 8" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2653">

			<p>Align a ruler marking with the lightly pressed folded edge of the fabric. That fold is straight and on grain now, so you’ll use that as your guide. </p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-9a.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 9A" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2654">

			<p>
				Your first cut will trim the excess, off grain fabric away. If you are left-handed, the part you are trimming away should be to the left of the ruler (above).
				If you’re right-handed, it should be to the right (below). You’ll switch sides when you start cutting strips for the quilt – this is just for squaring up the edge.
			</p>

			<img src="http://piecemealquilts.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/squaring-9b.jpg?w=640" alt="" title="Squaring 9B" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2655">

			<p>
				Place your hand on the ruler to hold it firmly in place. If it slips around, you may want to consider adding anti-slip plastic (OmniGrip), adhesive sandpaper
				dots, or even just a smear of rubber cement (let it dry!) to the back of your ruler. Make sure your fingers are not too close to the cutting edge – that rotary
				cutter can cause serious damage. Using firm, even pressure at the front edge of the blade, cut the fabric. Think “forward” when you’re cutting, not “down.”
			</p>

			<p>Here’s the right-handed version:</p>

			<p>You’ve squared up your fabric, and are now ready to start cutting. </p>
