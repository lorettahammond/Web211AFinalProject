<h1>5 Quilting Myths</h1>

		<p>
			What's the old saying... <em>rules are meant to be broken</em>? Quiltmaking is one craft where that statement is very true. It's best not to think of any
			specific method as a rule -- <em>guideline</em> is a better description. Once you have a bit of quilting experience, you'll know exactly which methods work for
			you in different situations, so never hesitate to break the 'rules.'
		</p>

		<p>You'll hear all sorts of myths related to quilt construction... let's talk about five.</p>


		<h3><em>Quilting Myth #1: Binding Should Always Be Made From Bias Strips</em></h3>

		<p>Bias binding strips are indeed one choice when it's time to make binding for a quilt, but they aren't always necessary.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Bias binding strips are stretchy, making them a cinch to sew (neatly) around quilts with curved edges, but bias strips aren't required for straight-edged quilts.</li>
			<li>On the plus side,&nbsp;threads in bias strips will end up running at an angle to the quilt itself -- if a thread in a strip eventually becomes weak and breaks, it will break around its own small portion of the binding, not all the way down the side of the quilt.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Crosswise Binding Strips</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Strips cut along the crosswise grain of fabric are a bit stretchy, too, and when cut, the grain is typically not completely straight -- a weakened thread will rarely cause a repair problem down the entire side of a quilt.</li>
			<li>Crosswise grain strips are more simple to make, and often (depending on available yardage) have fewer (bulky) connecting seams across their width, resulting in a neat, flat binding.</li>
			<li>Crosswise thread binding is a perfect choice for most quilts.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You <strong>should indeed</strong> avoid lengthwise grain binding strips. They have less stretch than crosswise strips, and their threads are more likely to run down a strip for a long distance -- a weak thread can make it necessary to repair binding on a longer portion of the quilt.</p>


		<h3><em>Quilting Myth #2: While We're Talking About Binding</em></h3>

		<p>
			One of my biggest binding pet peeves concerns the binding instructions that many quilting authors have traditionally written. I've cautioned quilters on this since
			I began writing quilting books in the 1990s, but still see incorrect instructions everywhere.
		</p>

		<p><em><strong>The Real Deal</em></strong></p>

		<p>
			When preparing to miter binding at the corner of a quilt, the point where you should stop and <a href="/od/quiltingglossary/g/backstitch.htm">backstitch</a> must
			be a distance equal to the seam allowance you are sewing.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If you're sewing a 1/4" seam, stop 1/4" before a corner.</li>
			<li>If you're sewing a 1/2" seam, stop 1/2" from the corner.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><em>A 1/4" seam allowance&nbsp;is a must if quilt blocks surround the outer edges of the quilt, since they have excess fabric 'built in' for that width.</em></p>

		<p>What if you have a border? I've made lots of miniature quilts with 1/8" bindings, and larger quilts with 1/2" bindings. Try stopping 1/4" from the edge of those quilts and you'll end up with a messy (if not impossible to construct) mitered corner. <strong>Stop sewing at the point that matches your seam allowance</strong> and the miter will create itself, almost automatically.</p>


		<h3><em>Quilting Myth #3: Seam Allowances Must Be Pressed to the Side</em></h3>

		<p><span>I do usually </span><a href="/od/pressingtechniques/ss/press_blocks.htm">press seam allowances</a><span> to one side when I'm constructing patchwork, because that method helps enhance accuracy when units, rows and the entire quilt are assembled. When seam allowances in adjoining units are pressed in opposite directions, the loft (or height) each allowance creates helps you butt intersections together for a perfect match.</span></p>

		<p>Sometimes you'll find that pressing seams to the side creates too much bulk, especially if lots of seams meet in a given spot of your patchwork. When that happens, <strong>don't be afraid to <a href="/od/stepbystepquilting/a/Quilt-Seam-Allowances.htm">press seams open</a></strong>.</p>

		<p>We've always been told that pressing seam allowances to one side strengthens a block or quilt, but I personally do not believe that is true. Some will disagree, but I know many quilters who press open all the time with great success.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Match-up Tip:</strong> When adjoining units with pressed-open seams, align edges and stab a straight pin through both narrow channels where each seam should meet. Leave the pin in place until the needle reaches that spot, remove the needle and keep sewing. Your seams should be perfectly matched.
		</p>

		<h3><em>Quilting Myth #4: Only Seniors Make Quilts</em></h3>


		<p>
			<span>I </span><em>hope</em><span>
				this old&nbsp;perception&nbsp;is finally dead and buried. Some of the most talented quilters out there are young people in their
				20s and 30s (and younger) proving that there's absolutely no 'age requirement' to become a successful quilter. Browse the Web and you'll find thousands upon thousands
				of young people turning their visions into quilts. I'll link to just a few:

		</ul>

		<h3><em>Quilting Myth #5: An Expensive Sewing Machine is a MUST</em></h3>

		<p>
			<span>It's true that sewing machines with every option available may help you piece and quilt with ease, but </span><em>
				an expensive sewing machine is not a
				must
			</em><span>. Many quilters sew patchwork on their vintage </span><a href="/od/essentialtoolssupplies/ig/Singer-Featherweight-Gallery/">
				Featherweight sewing
				machines
			</a><span>, and I know a few who love to sew on a </span><a href="/od/vintagesewingmachines/ig/Sewing-in-Women-s-History/Singer-Treadle-Sewing-Machine.htm">
				treadle machine
			</a><span>.</span>
		</p>

		<p>If you plan to machine quilt, do buy a machine that either comes with a <a href="/od/quiltingglossarywxyz/g/walking_foot.htm">walking foot</a> or can be fitted with a generic version made by an accessories manufacturer. Go for a more expensive machine later if you find that you love to make quilts (and your budget is okay with the purchase).</p>

		</p>

		<h3>Bottom Line</h3>

		<p>
			Never hesitate to experiment. We wouldn't have all of the quick piecing techniques (and tools) that are so popular today if quilters weren't inquisitive. You might
			be the next person who develops a brand new way to cut and sew patchwork or applique.
