        <h2>How to Read a Quilt Pattern</h2>


        <p>
            <em>How do you read a quilt pattern?</em>  This might seem like a straightforward question, but there are so many
            different types of quilt patterns found in so many different places that
            it is not as easy as it sounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some patterns, such as those found in books and magazines, are broken up
            with parts of the pattern in different places. For example, a book might
            group all the pictures in one place but the actual directions in
            another. If there are any special techniques used in the pattern, they
            might be found in a third place.
        </p>

        <p>
            Magazines do the same thing, often beginning the pattern on one page and
            continuing it in the back. Graphics in a magazine tend to be a bit
            condensed, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Free patterns provided by manufacturers are often VERY condensed,
            without detailed instructions and condensed or non existent graphics.
            Beware of these patterns. Like the little girl with the curl in the
            middle of her forehead, sometimes they are very, very good and sometimes
            they are horrid. Don&#8217;t automatically assume they are accurate.
        </p>

        <p>
            Patterns found in a quilt shop or on a designer&#8217;s site can also be
            anywhere from very good to very bad. The only way to know is to open the
            bag and read through the pattern.
        </p>

        <h3><em>Characteristics of a Good Quilting Pattern</em></h3>

        <p>
            A professionally created pattern will have a picture of the actual
            quilt, not just a graphic. Some graphics are really good. It can be
            hard to tell!&nbsp; It&#8217;s the only way you can know for sure that the quilt
            has been made. However, that doesn&#8217;t really mean that the directions are
            accurate. Some designers make the quilt first and write the directions
            later, which is how tiny errors creep in. This can cause a lot of
            frustration for the person trying to make the quilt. (Phoebe's Note:
            yes, I know our patterns often have a graphic for a picture.&nbsp;
            That's because I am a lousy photographer, a subject for a future
            article.)
        </p>

        <p>
            The outside of the pattern should also give the title, size(s) of the
            quilt and a little description, including color and/or fabric style
            suggestions. Can you only make it using a particular line of fabric
            and/or panel? Does the designer have a website or blog where you might
            see other versions of this quilt?
        </p>

        <p>
            A detailed list of fabric requirements and supplies should be given on
            the outside of the pattern. If a pattern uses precut fabric, that should
            be stated, along with the definition of that particular precut. The
            fabric requirements should clearly indicate what fabrics are required
            for which part of the pattern. Some patterns will just give a generic
            total, while others will be precisely state which fabric is to be used
            in which block. If you are making a scrap quilt, the generic total is
            fine but if you are purchasing fabric for a specific quilt design, you
            need to know what to buy.
        </p>

        <p>
            The pattern cover should also state the relative ease of the pattern and
            any special techniques needed, such as paper piecing or applique. If a
            special ruler is needed, that should be noted as well.

        <p>
            Another indication of a professionally written pattern are the little
            things. A pattern number indicates that this isn&#8217;t the designers only
            pattern. A bar code indicates that the designer has taken the time to
            apply for and purchase one for this pattern. A QR code is a high tech
            way of offering additional information. Scan it with the QR reader of
            your smart phone.
        </p>

        <p>
            One important piece of information on the outside of the quilt pattern
            should be the Copyright Statement. Good designers spend many, many hours
            creating their patterns, and have a large financial investment besides
            both in fabric and the cost of the software they use for creating the
            pattern. Their copyright will often indicate usage information. For
            example, can you make something for resale? Are you permitted to enter
            your quilt in a show? If it is a free pattern provided by a fabric or
            ruler manufacturer, the copyright may forbid the use of any
            substitution. Remember that all patterns carry a copyright even if it is
            not expressly declared.
        </p>

<h3><em>Things to Ponder</em></h3>

                <p>
                    Open the pattern and read through the entire thing. Think of it as a
                    recipe, each step building on the one before. Does the pattern seem to
                    be written in a logical order? Is it well written, grammatically correct
                    without a lot of typos? Are you comfortable with the size and style of
                    the typeface? If it is printed on a single large sheet which is folded,
                    can you figure out the sequence? Patterns like this can be very
                    confusing if the steps aren&#8217;t numbered.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Is each step explained? If a special ruler is required, do you own that
                    ruler and do you know how to use it? If not, is there an explanation in
                    the pattern or alternatives given? Sometimes a designer will offer a
                    more detailed explanation and/or a video on their website or blog. Is
                    there room on the pattern for you to make notes?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Are applique pieces full size? Are applique methods suggested and tips
                    given?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Block sizes should be stated with each step, or at least every other
                    step, so the quilter can check their work at each stage.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Are abbreviations defined? An experienced quilter will know these
                    definitions but not all designers define the same terms in the same
                    manner.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>WOF</li>
                    <li>1/4&quot; seam/scant 1/4&quot; seam</li>
                    <li>mirror image/reverse</li>
                    <li>sub cut/ cross cut</li>
                    <li>unit/template</li>
                    <li>QST, HST</li>
                    <li>finished/unfinished</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Look for graphics detailing each step, including pressing directions,
                    but don&#8217;t expect to be able to make the quilt from the graphics. Too
                    many graphics can be confusing and often a designer will put more than
                    one step in a graphic to save space. However, any tricky construction
                    method should have a detailed illustration.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Full color illustrations are usually the best, but not always. Sometimes
                    a grayscale illustration will better show color relationships. When
                    working with a pattern, it is helpful to go through it and cross off
                    their colors and write in yours. Likewise, if the quilt can be made in
                    more than one size, cross off the information for the sizes that do not
                    apply before you start sewing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Does the pattern include setting layout alternatives, batting and/or
                    quilting suggestions and binding instructions? You may not need this
                    information, but it can be helpful to new quilters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have any questions about a pattern before or after purchase,
                    contact the designer directly. They should have made the quilt and will
                    be able to accurately answer your question. In addition it gives them a
                    little constructive criticism. The next time that pattern is printed,
                    they may be able to reword the instructions to make them clearer.
