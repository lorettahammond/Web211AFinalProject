		<h2 class=”hdg”>Hand Quilting Tips & Techniques</h2>

		<p>
			There is just something unbelievably wonderful about the time-honored art of hand quilting. Not only does quilting done by hand remind us of the
			quilts from yesterday, but it also provides a soft finish that really can’t be achieved any other way. Though it is not difficult, hand quilting
			requires some skill that can be gained through practice.  The time you invest in hand quilting will be rewarded by the <em>ooohs</em> and <em>aaahs</em>  of admirers.
			Additionally, the financial value of your quilts will be significantly enhanced.
		</p>

		<p>Here are a few hand quilting basics that you should be aware of if you are just getting started or simply need a little refresher!</p>

		<h3>Guidelines for Hand Quilting:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Mark, layer, and thread baste.</li>

			<li>Use a good quality quilting thread and a quilting needle.</li>

			<li>You may use a running stitch or an up and down stitch.</li>

			<li>Keep your stitch length short, yet long enough to be even.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Supplies</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Quilting Frame</li>

			<li>Quilting Hoop</li>

			<li>Needles</li>

			<li>Thread</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<strong>Quilting frames</strong> and <strong>hoops</strong> are worth the investment if you do a lot of hand quilting.  Well-designed and
			constructed frames hold the layers in place, allow convenient access to the top and bottom of the quilt, and take up little space.  Some quilting
			frames (such as the Q-Snap frame) eliminate the need to baste the layers together.  This is a real time saver.
		</p>

		<p>
			Many different styles of hoops are available, including hand held hoops, lap hoops and standing quilt hoops. When hand quilting smaller projects,
			many quilters prefer not to use a hoop, but for larger projects they are a great help. One mistake often made by beginners is placing their quilt
			too tightly in the hoop. Since the fabric needs to be able to move up and down as you quilt, make sure there is enough “give” for some movement.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Needles</strong> are the most essential tool for hand quilting. Most experienced hand quilters agree that using the “between” style of
			needle works best for hand quilting. A size 10 is needle ideal,as the eye isn’t too big or too small, and the needle is strong enough to handle the
			layers of most quilt back designs, batting and quilt top without being too big and bulky.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Thread</strong> is another necessity for hand quilting. If you are using all cotton fabric, you will want to use a cotton thread. Many
			quilters find that coating their thread with a product like Thread Magic helps keep the thread from knotting while stitching. Since many quilters
			have different preferences when it comes to thread, you may have to try a few different types of quilting thread to find one that’s durable and yet
			easy to work with.



			<h3>How to Hand Quilt</h3>


			<dl class="margins-removed">

				<dt><strong><em>Step 1:</em></strong></dt>

				<dd>
					Begin by cutting an approximately 18” length of thread. Using a longer piece of thread tends to cause tangles, and using a shorter piece means
					you’ll be switching threads frequently.
				</dd>

				<dd>Tie a small knot in the end of your thread. You will be “burying” the knot inside of your quilt, so don’t make the knot too big.</dd>

				<dd>
					Pull your threaded needle through the back of the quilt, bringing up the needle in the exact spot you want to start hand quilting. Give a slight
					.tug so the knot goes through the backing fabric but doesn’t pull all the way through. This way the knot will be hidden in the interior of the quilt.
				</dd>


				<dt><strong><em>Step 2:</em></strong></dt>

				<dd>
					Start stitching. The ideal hand-quilting stitches are small and even. Keeping your stitches even is the most important part of the technique for
					beautiful hand quilting. Being able to quilt six stitches per inch is a good number for beginner and intermediate quilters to aim for with their
					quilting. More experienced quilters will quilt between eight and twelve stitches per inch.
				</dd>


				<dt><strong><em>Step 3:</em></strong></dt>

				<dd>
					Begin to hand quilt, keeping one hand underneath the quilt and one hand above. The bottom hand is used for stability, ensuring the needle goes
					all the way through to the back of the quilt and assisting in moving the needle back to the top.<br />
				</dd>

				<dd>
					Your top hand will move the needle down into the fabric and up again. Do not pull the thread all the way through at this point. You will want to
					“load” several (two or three) stitches on your needle using this technique.
				</dd>

				<dd>
					When you have a few stitches loaded onto your needle, pull the thread all the way through, taking care to use an even tension. You will then use
					the up-down motion to load the next several stitches on the needle before pulling the thread all the way through.
				</dd>

				<dd>Continue in this manner until you have quilted your desired areas.</dd>

				<dd>
					Keeping your stitches even and using equal tension each time you pull the thread all the way through are the two most important things to keep in
					mind. Try hand quilting on smaller projects like pillow tops and table runners, and you will quickly gain the confidence to quilt your larger
					projects.
