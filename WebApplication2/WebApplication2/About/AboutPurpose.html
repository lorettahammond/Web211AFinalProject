<h2 class=”hdg”>Purpose: Gathering Stitches</h2>

		
	<p>As a child, my family and I enjoyed summer vacations with my paternal grandparents.  While I enjoyed visiting all of my family, I was particularly
	fascinated when visiting my grandmother and aunts.  They all quilted.</p>
	
	<p>Every evening after dinner, they gathered and worked on their respective quilt projects.  The projects varied from simple scrap patchwork quilts to 
	intricate appliquéd quilts.  Each so very lovely and unique. <p>
	
	<p>As I was mesmerized by their handy work, I often thought if I could learn to quilt. At such a young age, I thought it would be far too difficult to 
	learn. Fear of being told "no" stopped me from asking one of my aunts to teach me.</p>
	
	<p>Years later as a young adult, I set my mind to teaching myself to quilt.  Sadly, there was no one around to help me or ask questions. There was no such 
	thing as a YouTube video or extensive website dedicated to quilting. </p>
	
	<p>Some other ideas to get you quilting include:
	
		<ul>

			<li><strong>Join a guild.</strong> Most communities have quilting guilds. They welcome new members and are eager to teach beginners quilting. 
			Guild members are a great source of information, encouragement, and friendship.</li>
			<li><strong>Take classes and workshops.</strong> Every teacher offers something different, and their expertise will be invaluable as you learn to 
			quilt.</li>
			<li><strong>Choose the right basic quilting supplies</strong>. Invest materials and tools like good quality thread, sturdy cutting tools, and a reliable
			sewing machine. Check out <em><a href="http://www.interweavestore.com/sewing-machine-secrets">Sewing Machine Secrets</a></em> to discover incredible expert advice to help you make the 
			best choices when it comes to buying and using your sewing machine. You'll be glad you did!</li>
			<li><strong>Start with small, easy quilts. </strong>Choose a small art quilt or beginner quilt patterns like a nine-patch for your first project. 
			Learning how to make a simple quilt will teach you the basics you'll need for more advanced projects.</li>
			<li><strong>Learn the lingo. </strong>Get familiar with basic quilting terms. Before long you'll understand most of the terms you'll need in order to 
			follow a beginner quilting pattern, but be sure you look up any unfamiliar terms that you come across before continuing.</li>
			<li><strong>Relax, enjoy, experiment,</strong> but most of all, have fun!</li>
