<p>A quilt kit, typically, contain the basic things needed to make a quilt, such as the pattern and fabric.  They are designed to speed up the often long 
and elaborate process of making a quilt. The fabric in a kit usually comes cut into the proper size and shape so that all the quilter needs to do is sew the pieces 
together.</p>


<p>Using quilt kits can save the quilter the frustration of having to select and match fabrics for the quilt. The kits often include several fabric designs, usually from 
the same designer and line of fabric. Some kits may mix and match designs from different fabric lines. Usually, the fabrics are picked out by a person with plenty of 
experience in and knowledge of coordinating fabrics and quilt making.</p>

<p>The pattern for the quilt is also usually included in a quilt kit. The pattern tells the quilter the proper way to lay out the cut pieces of fabric and how to go 
about sewing the fabrics together. While quilt kits are typically designed to make a quilt of a certain size and only contain enough fabric to make that size quilt, 
a quilter can use the pattern to make any size quilt as long as she has the proper amount of fabric.</p>
